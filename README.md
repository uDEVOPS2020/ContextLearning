# The μDevOps learning engine. 

This repository contains the artifacts related to the context learning functionality foreseen by the μDevOps EU MSCA RISE project (www.udevops.eu), Deliverable 2.2. The context learning functionality aims at supprting Software Quality Assurance (SQA) activities in Microservice DevOps engineering. Specifically, 4 use cases are described by which the following SQA activities are supported, which are especially relevant for engineering Microservice Archicteture (MSA) applications in a DevOps environment: *(Regression) Testing*, *Performance-related causal structure discovery in a Microservice Architecture*, *Anomaly detection and root cause analysis*, *Just-in-time software defect prediction*. 

Details about the techniques used and a description of the use case are available in the accompayning document, at www.udevops.eu. 

Will find a Readme file in every use case that describes the content and usage. 

*Note: This GitHub repository is meant to be evolved as the project advances.*
